## AWS Lambda  

AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales and executes code in response to events, such as HTTP requests, database changes, or file uploads.  

### Key Features  
- **Pay-as-you-go pricing** – You only pay for execution time.  
- **Event-driven execution** – Triggers from AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.  
- **Automatic scaling** – Handles multiple requests without manual intervention.  

### Use Cases  
- Running backend logic for web apps  
- Data processing in real-time  
- Automating infrastructure tasks
